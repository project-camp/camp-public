This project provides a complete analytical framework for portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) geochemical data from ethno-archaeological sites. The workflow integrates compositional data analysis with advanced geostatistical modeling to understand spatial patterns of human activity areas.

## üî¨ Core Features

<details>
<summary><strong>Data Preparation & Quality Control</strong></summary>
Handles pXRF data preprocessing including spatial coordinate matching, limit of detection (LOD) correction, element selection based on analytical reliability, and compositional data closure using expectation-maximization algorithms for below-detection-limit imputation.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Exploratory Statistical Analysis</strong></summary>
Implements compositional data analysis using centered log-ratio (CLR) and isometric log-ratio (ILR) transformations, principal component analysis on CLR-transformed data, correlation analysis adapted for compositional constraints, cluster analysis using Aitchison distances, and multivariate statistical testing including PERMANOVA and discriminant analysis.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Spatial Analysis</strong></summary>
Applies exploratory spatial data analysis including elemental mapping, inverse distance weighting interpolation, swath plots for directional trends, variogram analysis for spatial correlation structures, and anisotropy assessment for directional spatial dependencies.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Geostatistical Modeling</strong></summary>
Utilizes advanced cokriging techniques with linear models of coregionalization (LMC), universal cokriging for non-stationary spatial processes, omnidirectional and directional variogram modeling, Maximum/Minimum Autocorrelation Factor (MAF) analysis for dimensionality reduction, and comprehensive model validation through cross-validation and spatial accuracy assessment.

## üìÇ Project Structure & Scripts

The analytical workflow is divided into four sequential scripts:

-   `01_data_preprocessing`: Prepares raw pXRF data for analysis.
-   `02_multivariate_analysis`: Performs statistical analysis and clustering.
-   `03_spatial_analysis`: Conducts spatial exploration and variogram analysis.
-   `04_geostatistical_modeling`: Implements advanced cokriging models and validation.
